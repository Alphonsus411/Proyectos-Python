"""Use Python to calculate how many number-based passcodes can be formed with 10 numerals (0 through 9).  
For a 1 numeral passcode, there would be 10 possibilities.  
For a 2 numeral passcode, each numeral is independent of the other, so there would be 10 times 10 possibilities.  
Using this information, print the amount of possible passwords that can be formed with 8 numerals. 
Note: Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence."""

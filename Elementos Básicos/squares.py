# Use a list comprehension to create a list of squared numbers (n*n). The function receives the variables start and end, and returns a list of squares of consecutive numbers between start and end inclusively.
# For example, squares(2, 3) should return [4, 9].

def squares(start, end):
    return [x * x for x in range(start, end + 1)]


print(squares(2, 3))  # Should be [4, 9]
print(squares(1, 5))  # Should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares(0, 10))  # Should be [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

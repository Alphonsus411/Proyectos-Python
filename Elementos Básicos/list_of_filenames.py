"""
Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. 
To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. 
Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods youâ€™ve learned thus far, 
like a for loop or a list comprehension.

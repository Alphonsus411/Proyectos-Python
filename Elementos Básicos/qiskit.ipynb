    "Qiskit is a package in Python for doing everything you'll ever need with quantum computing.\n",

    "If you don't have it already, you need to install it. Once it is installed, you need to import it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are generally two steps to installing Qiskit. The first one is to install Anaconda, a python package that comes with almost all dependencies that you will ever need. Once you've done this, Qiskit can then be installed by running the command \n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install qiskit\n",
    "```\n",
    "in your terminal. For detailed installation instructions, refer to [the documentation page here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: The rest of this section is intended for people who already know the fundamental concepts of quantum computing.** It can be used by readers who wish to skip straight to the later chapters in which those concepts are put to use. All other readers should read the [Introduction to Python and Jupyter notebooks](../ch-prerequisites/python-and-jupyter-notebooks.html), and then move on directly to the start of [Chapter 1](../ch-states/introduction.html)."

"""
Fill in the blanks to complete the function, which should output a multiplication table. 
The function accepts a variable “number” through its parameters. This “number” variable should be multiplied by the numbers 1 through 5, and printed in a format similar to “1x6=6” (“number” x “multiplier” = “result”). The code should also limit the “result” to not exceed 25. To satisfy these conditions, you will need to:

- Initialize the “multiplier" variable with the starting value

- Complete the while loop condition

- Add an exit point for the loop

- Increment the “multiplier" variable inside the while loop
